    <h3> A delicious and healthy way to use up your blueberries! </h3>
    <p> A quick recipe you can make while trying to decide what to eat 
        for breakfast. Great if you are trying to figure out what to do 
        with those blueberries in the fridge or freezer! Also great 
        on-the-go! Delicious and includes many foods that are a great 
        way to start your day! Many of the ingredients, except for the 
        blueberries and yogurt, are optional and vary depending on your 
        own taste. This recipe is super versatile, and you can change it depending 
        on dietary needs or personal preference. Have fun with it! </p>
